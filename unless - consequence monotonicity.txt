It is called consequence weakening in Chandy & Misra but since we're using it as a calculus, we need to using both as a strengthening and as a weakening.  Monotonicity illustrate this best.

(0)		[ ( (p un q)  ⇒  (p un r) )  ⇐  G •(q ⇒ r) ]

We will prove (0) by taking shunting the implication and manipulating only (p un r).  Since we have a rule to manipulate •p ( p un q ), we will start with that side of the demonstration.

		   •p
		⇒	{ p un q }
		   (G •p) ; S ; •q
		⇒	{ G •(q ⇒ r) }
		   (G •p) ; S ; •r
